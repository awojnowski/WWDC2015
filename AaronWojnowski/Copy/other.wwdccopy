In addition to the iOS apps mentioned previously, I also do a fair amount of consulting on a day to day basis for other apps and companies. Some other projects I've worked on include:

- Winnipeg Headlines - a news and RSS aggregator used by thousands of people in Winnipeg
- An app where I wrote fully custom circular progress/slider controls, live blurring overlays, realtime photo editing, and more
- An app which mixes various video and audio content into a single playlist
- A large scale fashion and clothing marketplace with high resolution item viewing, responsive collection views, and more

One of my favorite parts about development is meeting new people and working on projects used by real consumers in the real world. There is nothing more satisfying for me than seeing something that I built in the hands of a user, especially when that product positively affects their lives.
