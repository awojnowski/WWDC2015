Nearly last but definitely not least are the sessions.

Most of all, I'm looking forward to the scroll view and table/collection view sessions, audio and AVFoundation sessions, definitely the UI/UX sessions, and also some other UIKit sessions.

I like to consider myself to be proficient when working with UIKit on iOS. Hearing what new technologies and best practices have emerged in the last year is valuable for me as a developer, for my own projects.
