Nearly last but definitely not least are the sessions.

Most of all, I'm looking forward to the scroll view and table/collection view sessions, audio and AVFoundation sessions, definitely the UI/UX sessions, and also some other UIKit sessions.

I like to consider myself to be proficient when working with UIKit on iOS, and hearing what new technologies and best practices have emerged is valuable for me as a developer.
