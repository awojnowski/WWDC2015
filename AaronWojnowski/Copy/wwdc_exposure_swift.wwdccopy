For the most part, I've not started working with Swift due to the lack of best practices that have been established. Although I read a significant amount of articles, it's hard to know what will be the best way to do things in the future, like what I know with Objective-C.

One reason that I want to come to WWDC is to be exposed to Apple's engineers and see their code examples and explanations. This will give me a better idea of what Apple is doing with Swift which can in turn be brought over to my own development projects.
