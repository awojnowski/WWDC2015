Fannex is an application that I built and still manage, for the Winnipeg company, Emotion Media Inc. After my experiences with Minus and other applications, Fannex wasn't inherently challenging but I did learn a lot about project structure and the best way to manage multi-targeted projects. I also learned al ot about further working with development teams and different development styles.

Since Fannex is built for multiple teams, I had to come up with an efficient way to to structure data within the Xcode project, such that in a flick of a switch, the application could be skinned for another team entirely. In addition to this, Fannex also has an SDK component which means that I had to not only allow for the building of consumer apps, but also a framework which incorporated the Fannex back-end.
