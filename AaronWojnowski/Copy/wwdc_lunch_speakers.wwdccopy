In the past, I was fortunate enough to attend WWDC and one thing that stood out significantly were the lunchtime speakers. In 2013, hearing Bill Nye talk was both funny and inspiring. I'm extremely excited to see what speakers are going to be at WWDC 2015 and potentially have the opportunity to hear their talks.
