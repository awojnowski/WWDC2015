I began working with Minus when I was in grade 10, after 1 year of working with iOS. At the time, I didn't have experience working with images, the web, etc. Because of this, Minus was an incredible learning experience since their entire service was predicated image uploading on the internet.

For the first two years at Minus, I worked on their photo sharing application for iPad and iPhone. During this time, I experimented with concurrent upload operations, uploading videos and photos, working with different file types on iOS, and ultimately refinining UI and UX for Minus's users.

In late 2012, Minus pivoted to a photo sharing and nearby chat application. At this time, they brought on some other developers and the iOS team of one turned into a team of four. It was at this time that I received a lot of experience working with remote teams, in a group, collaboration through Git, etc.

In their latest application, Meow Chat, I've built a few custom UI controls and other UIKit related components in addition to some fine grain animations throughout the app. An example of these UI components would be a custom segmented control which was customizable through simple color properties and also fit the Meow look without having to bloat the app with images.
