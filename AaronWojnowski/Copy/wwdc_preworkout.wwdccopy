When attending WWDC previously, I never expected how inspired I would be to develop for the iOS platform after attending. I consider myself to be quite enthusiastic and inspired, but it was on a whole other level. It felt like pre-workout (supplements taken before working out to get hyped), except for iOS development.

One of my largest reasons for wanting to go to WWDC is to be around like minded developers, hear from others building apps on iOS, and hear Apple's thoughts on the iOS development ecosystem. In turn, this inspires me to build more applications and work harder to refine my skills as an iOS developer.
